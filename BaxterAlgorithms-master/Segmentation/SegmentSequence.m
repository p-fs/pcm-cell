function oBlobSeq = SegmentSequence(aImData, varargin)
% Segments cells in an entire image sequence.
%
% The function segments all images in an image sequence by calling either
% Segment_generic or Segment_generic3D. The function can also save
% mat-files with segmentation results to the analysis folder of the
% experiment. Such files can be loaded later if an interrupted processing
% session is resumed, or if segmentation results from an old tracking
% result should be reused. The function also computes all features that are
% necessary for classification of cell counts, mitosis, and apoptosis.
%
% Inputs:
% aImData - ImageData object for the image sequence.
%
% Property/Value inputs:
% Features - Cell array with a list of features that should be computed.
%            This can be used to compute more features than the features
%            that are required by the current classifiers. This can be
%            useful for development of new classifiers. The caller must
%            make sure that the features required for classification are
%            included in the feature list.
% CreateOutputFiles - If this parameter is set to false, the program will
%                     not create any files with segmentation results or any
%                     other files. This can be used in tracking challenges
%                     when there are rules against creating new files in
%                     the data directories.
% NumCores - The number of processor cores to be used for processing. If
%            this is set to more than 1, the segmentation and the feature
%            computation will be parallelized over the images of the image
%            sequence.
%
% Outputs:
% oBlobSeq - Cell array with one cell per frame, where each cell contains
%            an array of Blob objects that were segmented out in that
%            frame.
