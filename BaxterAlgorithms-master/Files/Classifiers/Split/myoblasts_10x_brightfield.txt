Classifier trained on primary murine myoblasts, imaged in 10x bright field microscopy with an imaging frequency of one frame every 3 minutes.

This is a logistic regression classifier trained on the image sequence "10X 3min acquistion BF__C04_02.tif_Files" in the dataset "2012_04_11_Penney_myoblasts_10x_5min_For Klas journal viterbi paper". The classifier was used in [1] and uses the feature set called TransmissionFeatures. The classifier used to be called 131029_myoblasts_watershedsMnrPca and the feature set used to be called TheriaultAlmostExtendedFeatures. The feature 'CenterDistance' was not used, as the dataset has no microwell.
