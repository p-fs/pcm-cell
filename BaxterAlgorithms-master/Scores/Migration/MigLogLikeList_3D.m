function oList = MigLogLikeList_3D(aBlobSeq, aImData, aMaxArcs)
% Computes migration log-likelihoods in 3D image stacks.
%
% The function computes the log-likelihoods of possible migrations
% between detections (blobs) in consecutive frames of 3D image stacks.
%
% In the motion model it is assumed that the x-, y-, and z-velocities
% are independent and distributed according to Gaussian distributions. The
% migration probabilities in one time step are assumed to be independent of
% the migration probabilities of other time steps. Clutter is assumed to
% follow a uniform distribution. The function is equivalent to
% MigLogLikeList_uniformClutter, but works on 3D images.
%
% Only the aMaxArcs most likely migrations in each time direction are
% returned. This means that the aMaxArcs most likely migrations that move
% from a given detection and the aMaxArcs most likely migrations that end
% in a given detection are returned. A migration is only returned once,
% even if it is among the most likely outgoing migrations from one
% detection and among the most likely incoming migrations to another
% detection.
%
% Inputs:
% aBlobSeq - Cell array where cell t contains a vector with all Blob
%            objects created through segmentation of frame t.
% aImData - Image data object associated with the image sequence.
% aMaxArcs - The number of outgoing and incoming migrations considered for
%            every detection.
%
% Properties in aImData:
% TrackMotionModel - Name of mat-file where a mean and a covariance matrix
%                    of the x-, y-, and z-displacements have been saved.
%                    The mean and the covariance should be saved in
%                    variables named 'means' and 'covariance'. If
%                    'TrackMotionModel' is 'none' the mean will be set to 0
%                    and the covariance matrix will be defined by
%                    TrackXSpeedStd and TrackZSpeedStd.
% TrackXSpeedStd - Standard deviation of Brownian motion in the x- and
%                  y-dimensions. This value is used if TrackMotionModel has
%                  not been defined. The unit is pixels (voxel widths). If
%                  TrackXSpeedStd is a two element vector, the covariance
%                  matrix will be time-varying. In that case the first
%                  element defines the standard deviation in the first
%                  frame and the second element defined the standard
%                  deviation in the last frame. The standard deviation in
%                  intermediate frames are computed using linear
%                  interpolation.
% TrackZSpeedStd - Standard deviation of Brownian motion in the
%                  z-dimension. This value is used if TrackMotionModel has
%                  not been defined. The unit is pixels (voxel widths).
%                  This means that the motion will be isotropic if
%                  TrackXSpeedStd and TrackZSpeedStd are the same, even if
%                  the voxel height is different from the voxel width. A
%                  TrackXSpeedStd with two elements will make the
%                  covariance matrix time-varying, in the same way as
%                  TrackXSpeedStd.
%
% Outputs:
% oList - N x 5 matrix, where N is the number of returned migrations.
%         The elements of the matrix are:
%    oList(:,1) - Frame index of the first detection in the migration.
%    oList(:,2) - The index of the detection in image oList(:,1).
%    oList(:,3) - The index of the detection in image oList(:,1)+1.
%    oList(:,4) - Log-likelihood of the migration NOT occurring.
%    oList(:,5) - Log-likelihood of the migration occurring.
