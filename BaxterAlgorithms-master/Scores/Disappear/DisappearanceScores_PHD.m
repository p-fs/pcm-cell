function oList = DisappearanceScores_PHD(aPHD, aImData)
% Uses a GM-PHD to compute scores for events where objects disappear.
%
% Probabilities of migration out of the field of view are computed by
% propagating all components in the GM-PHD one time step forward in time
% and then integrating the Gaussian distributions over the image. The
% probability of disappearance is 1 minus the integral. The integration is
% taken care of by mvncdf. The function can handle Brownian motion,
% constant velocity motion and an IMM model which switches between the two.
% The function also incorporates the user specified probability of random
% disappearance anywhere in the image. The returned scores are the
% logarithms of the event probabilities. It is assumed that the Gaussian
% components in the GM-PHDs that are given as input are ordered in the same
% way as the corresponding blobs that are used for tracking in Track.
%
% Inputs:
% aPHD - Array where each element is a measurement updated GM-PHD for one
%        time point. The GM-PHDs can be either CellPHD objects or
%        CellPHD_IMM objects.
% aImData - ImageData object of the image sequence.
%
% Outputs:
% oList - N x 4 matrix, where N is the number of returned disappearance
%         events. The elements of the matrix are:
%    oList(:,1) - Image index.
%    oList(:,2) - Index of the Gaussian component in image oList(:,1).
%    oList(:,3) - Log likelihood of the disappearance event NOT occurring.
%    oList(:,4) - Log likelihood of the disappearance event occurring.
